Pen Servo: 
 
For a pen bot I want to use the spindle PWM to control a servo.
In stepper.c it will will look at the Z position. Any Z>0 is pen up.
 
The spindle output is using a PWM, but we need to adjust that 
 
We only need a rough value because we are only up and down
 
Use 1024 prescaler to get. ... 16,000,000 Mhz  / 1024 = 15625 Hz
It is an 8 bit timer so 15625 / 256 = 61 Hz. This is pretty close the the 50Hz recommended for servos
Each tick = 0.000064sec 
One end of servo is 0.001 sec (0.001 / 0.000064 = 15.6 ticks)
The other end is 0.002 sec (0.002 / 0.000064 = 31 ticks)
